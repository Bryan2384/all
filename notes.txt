--------------------------------------------
TO DO:
- Write code for the extensions North to be fully filled.  Currently, distributors are spending all energy in storage. Write a function that sorts by type and prioritizes what gets filled where
        
- Identify pontetial issues and plan for them:
    1. destroyed containers
    
- Differentiate between static and nonstatic roles better in naming of roles 

- Add code to keep ramparts at X% of hitpoints instead of 100%
- Implement more tower code
    a. Towers need to repair
    b. Towers need to heal
--------------------------------------------

CHANGE LOG:
1/13/2020
    *Added code to prioritize structures to fill (EXTENSIONS > TOWERS > SPAWN > STORAGE) to distributors
    
1/11/2020
    *Added "ignoreCreeps: true" to creep.pos.findClosestByPath calls
    *Replaced vars for minimum number of roles for constants

1/10/2020
    *Reached RCL 7
    *Doubled distributor body parts
    *Upgrader +3 WORK, +3 CARRY, +3 MOVE
    
1/9/2020
    *Added "survival spawning" code

1/3/2020
    *Added code for upgraders to take energy from storage if storage has over 250k energy
    *Added code to spawn miners if a miner is dead, despite of the population limit
    
12/31/19
    *Woke up again to an empty room.  Happened because a container decayed into nothing and it completely killed the economy.
     Need logic to ensure there is never an empty room
     
12/30/19
    *Woke up to an empty room.  Miner bodies equaled more than 300 energy, so when creeps died due to whatever, nothing else spawned
    *Created "miner2" role.  This role sends a miner to the other container.
    *Added code to miner that tells them to go to a container not being used -> DONE

12/29/19
    *Changed role "upgrader2" to "lorry"
    *Removed upgrader role change in miners (no carry body part, cannot harvest/upgrade/etc)
    *Added "[role name]2" to all roles. Roles with 2 at the end use containers instead of energy sources
    *Implemented static mining, woohoo!
        - Miners are only going to 1 container... need them to go to both

12/28/19
    *Continue to adjust spawn limit and body parts limits
    *Harvesters were sitting still if towers, spawns, or extensions were full.  Adde code to now make them they go upgrade

12/26/19
    *ADDED code for miner to change role to UPGRADER if all containers are full
        - doesnt work because miner cannot have carry parts.  Hmmm...
    *Miner only needs one MOVE part

12/24/19
    Current state:
        1. Things happening in main:
            a. Delete memory of dead creeps
            b. Call scripts depending on role name of screeps
            c. Tower code: attack hostiles.
            d. Set up minimum numbers allowed of each role and only spawn those amounts allowed
                
        2. Role scripts:
            a. Builder: builds things when there are things to be built. ALT script: harvest
            b. Harvester: harvest from energy sources and fill SPAWN, EXTENSIONS, or TOWERS
            c. Miner: find empty container, go to it, and harvest energy, which drops in container
            d. Repairer: find STRUCTURE that needs to be repaired.  ALT script: builder
            e. Upgrader: upgrade controller.  if empty of energy, harvest from energy source
            f. Upgrader2: upgrade controller.  if empty of energy, go to nearest container with energy and withdraw
